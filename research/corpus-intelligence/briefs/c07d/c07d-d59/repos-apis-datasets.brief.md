## What it is (1-2 sentences)
An Instagram-sweep inventory dated 2026-10-01 of GitHub repositories, free APIs, and datasets harvested from IG creator posts (@ariacodez, @autoinvent_, @simplifyinai, @seb.ai, @dhirajjij), each verified via the GitHub API on 2026-10-01 and split into permissive-license "CLEAR to evaluate," "LICENSE DILIGENCE required," free APIs, and unverified-claims buckets.

## Key metrics/methods (formulas where given, else "not specified")
not specified — no formulas. The file's method is license triage: permissive-license repos (MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD-3) are marked CLEAR to evaluate; AGPL-3.0/GPL-3.0/NOASSERTION repos are flagged "learn, don't integrate." Exact star counts as of 2026-10-01 (see Findings).

## Data sources named
- GitHub API (verification method, run 2026-10-01).
- Free APIs: CourtListener (Free Law Project) court records search API; Quiver Quant (public congressional + Form 4 insider data); Google Patents (not-in-force patent mining); perchance.org (free unlimited generators — quality check owed); ESPN scoreboard API (already in use; schedule verified 2026-10-01).
- Instagram accounts as sources: @ariacodez, @autoinvent_, @simplifyinai, @seb.ai, @dhirajjij.

Claims UNVERIFIED / no repo found:
- "coingecko-jev" (@simplifyinai carousel) — no official repo exists; claim treated as engagement bait
- "Lot Vulture AI" (@simplifyinai) — project unverified; METHOD (synthetic Blender data) extracted instead
- @seb.ai / @dhirajjij DM'd repos — exact repos ungated-unverified

## Intelligence connections (tag each: QB-BEHAVIOR, COACHING, OL, TRUST-SIGNAL, SCHEME, OTHER)
- OTHER — ADAPT debate mechanic: the file explicitly flags TauricResearch/TradingAgents (109,447★, Apache-2.0, "multi-agent trading debate") as an ADAPT debate mechanic candidate; this serves the agent-fleet/multi-agent reasoning lane, a permissive-licensed starting point for a debate-style ensemble rather than a single-model decision — relevant to calibration/sizing research (debate mechanics are an established method for de-correlating ensemble votes).
- OTHER — agent fleet management with spend caps: paperclipai/paperclip (95,655★, MIT) is catalogued for agent fleet management + spend caps; serves the agent-fleet operations lane (cost discipline), not engine modeling.
- OTHER — agent learning memory: vectorize-io/hindsight (44,180★, MIT); serves the continuous-learning / lessons-learned lane (relevant to the DFS process system's lessons-learned log and the calibration lane's memory of past errors).
- OTHER — synthetic-data METHOD extracted: from unverified "Lot Vulture AI," the sweep salvaged the METHOD — synthetic Blender data generation. This is a METHOD extraction (aligned with the standing "the play is the METHOD, not the equation" doctrine) and serves the tracking lane (synthetic training data for computer vision, e.g., pose/mesh pipelines) — flagged as salvaged-from-unverified-claim, so UNCERTAIN on provenance.
- OTHER — trading-agent methods (intelligent-trading-bot, Vibe-Trading, TradingAgents, claude-trading-skills, QuantMuse): several are marked paper-only; QuantMuse noted stale 2025-07-29. These serve the calibration/sizing lane only as learnable methods (bet-sizing, risk management) — none are sports data.
- TRUST-SIGNAL — free no-friction APIs: ESPN scoreboard API is confirmed already in use with schedule verified 2026-10-01; CourtListener and Quiver Quant (congressional + Form 4 insider data) are no-key free APIs. These serve the trust-target intake lane — CourtListener/Quiver Quant are off-field signal candidates (legal/behavioral signals per the total-signal doctrine: ingest EVERY signal), at zero cost.
- OTHER — scraping legality caveat: apify/crawlee is CLEAR (Apache-2.0) but carries an explicit "respect robots/ToS" caveat — reinforces the source-licensing doctrine (cf. the Scores24 review).
- UNCERTAIN: perchance.org is listed as "free unlimited generators" but a quality check is explicitly marked as owed — do not treat as validated.

## Engine-actionable? (yes/no + one-line what)
yes — TauricResearch/TradingAgents (109,447★, Apache-2.0) is an evaluated, permissive-licensed multi-agent debate mechanic flagged ADAPT-relevant; lift its debate/ensemble mechanism as the debate layer for the engine's multi-signal ensemble, and apify/crawlee (Apache-2.0) is a ToS-respecting scraping/browser-automation library for the off-field intake lane.
