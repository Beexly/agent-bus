<NATIVE_REASONING>
The user wants me to analyze a specific research paper about data-driven lowlight and highlight reel creation based on explainable temporal game models. I need to produce a response with specific XML sections, each with certain content requirements.

Let me break down the requirements:

1. ZERO BETTING LINES: Never mention spreads, totals, moneylines, or odds.
2. ZERO TOY EQUATIONS: Never invent fake ratios (Force / Fatigue). State formal LaTeX equations, SI/information/probability units, assumptions, and exact singularity/breakdown regimes. When source pages are provided, cite exact [PAGE N] markers and verbatim quotes.
3. >= 1,000-WORD DEPTH across these exact XML sections:
   - <THINK_TRACE>Deep multi-hop derivation & gray-zone audit (>=400 words).</THINK_TRACE>
   - <SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS>Formal LaTeX, units, page citations, breakdown.</SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS>
   - <RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY>Historical/scientific lineage & multi-week traps.</RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY>
   - <RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND>Crisis habit regression vs counter-trap vs clock.</RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND>
   - <CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION>Physical/biomechanical/weather veto proof.</CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION>
   - <RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES>3 verifiable RLVR veto scenarios + predictions.</RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES>

I need to be careful about the source text. The paper is from MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2019. Authors: Evin Keane, Philippe Desaulniers, Luke Bornn and Mehrsan Javan from SPORTLOGiQ. Pages 12 (though the text shows up to page 15 including references/appendix, but user said PAGES: 12).

Key content from paper:
- Framework for automatic highlight/lowlight extraction based on game event data
- Adjusts valuation based on impact on game's result
- Minimum entropy threshold to avoid monotony
- Event Interest (EI) as continuous function across time
- Cumulative Event Interest (CEI) for extracting highlights
- Applied to hockey
- Uses Markov Model for game state valuation
- Impact score I(a) = V_b(e) - V_o(e) or difference in changes
- Game context adjustment using win probability model
- Poisson distribution of score count based on league-wide even-strength zero score differential scoring rate + remaining time
- I_adj(e) formula (though the actual equation image isn't in text, I can reference the description)
- Entropy H formula with n distinct event types, p_i probability
- CEI = sum of EI over all events at each moment t
- Gaussian function for EI smoothing
- Breaks in continuous play handling
- Dataset: 8,810,580 events from NHL 2016-17 and 2017-18 regular seasons and playoffs
- 13 general action types, 108 unique values
- Coordinate system: feet, x from -100 to +100, y from -42.5 to 42.5
- Markov model details: states defined by event type, location, outcome, team; contexts by period, score differential, manpower differential, goalies on ice
- Value iteration with reward 1.0 for goal, 0.0 otherwise
- Terminal states: goal and neutral zone faceoff

I must not invent fake equations. I should use the actual LaTeX-like notation from the paper where possible, or formal mathematical descriptions based strictly on the text.

I need to cite page markers [PAGE N]. Looking at the source, page numbers are marked in the text like "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 1" etc. I need to map content to pages.

Page 1: Abstract, Introduction start
Page 2: Introduction continued, Section 2 In-Game Value Models
Page 3: Section 3 Methods, 3.1 Impact Score, 3.2 Game Context Adjustment start
Page 4: Game Context Adjustment continued, equations mentioned
Page 5: 3.3 Aggregating Impact Values, 3.3.1 Variety-Value Tradeoff, entropy
Page 6: 3.3.2 Event Interest, 3.3.3 Clip Length, CEI, Figure 1
Page 7: 3.3.4 Adjustment for breaks in continuous play, Figure 2
Page 8: Figure 3, Section 4 Sport Dataset
Page 9: Section 4.1 Event Valuation Model, Markov model details
Page 10: Figure 4, Section 5 Results, 5.1 Single Event Highlights

Page 12: 5.3 Auto-Generated Mini-Game, Figure 5, 5.4 Graphical Game Summary, Figure 6

Page 14: References
Page 15: Appendix A, B

User said PAGES: 12, so I should primarily cite pages 1-12, maybe up to 12. I'll cite exact [PAGE N] markers where I reference specific content.

Now, for the XML sections:

1. <THINK_TRACE>: Deep multi-hop derivation & gray-zone audit (>=400 words). I need to derive the logic chain: event data -> state valuation -> impact score -> context adjustment -> entropy variety -> continuous EI -> CEI -> threshold extraction -> mini-game format. Also audit gray zones: assumption that EI = fan interest, proprietary dataset, Markov model limitations, Gaussian choice, entropy threshold arbitrariness, breaks in play handling, terminal states definition.

2. <SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS>: Formal LaTeX, units, page citations, breakdown. I need to write out the equations described in the paper using LaTeX. Since some equations are images in the PDF and not transcribed as text, I need to reconstruct them faithfully from the textual description without inventing fake ratios. I can describe:
   - I(a) = ΔV_base(e) - ΔV_opp(e) or similar based on text: "difference between the change of values resulted from the action taken by the base and the opposing teams."
   - Win probability adjustment using Poisson distribution.
   - I_adj(e) = w_home * ΔP(home win) + w_visitor * ΔP(visitor win) [from description]
   - Entropy H = -Σ p_i log(p_i)
   - CEI(t) = Σ_{i=1}^n EI(I_adj^(e_i), t)
   - Gaussian EI with std dev σ
   - Markov reward: R=1.0 for goal, 0.0 otherwise
   - Value iteration for state values V(s)
   - Units: seconds, feet, probability [0,1], events count

3. <RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY>: Historical/scientific lineage & multi-week traps. Lineage: Markov decision processes (MDPs), value iteration (Bellman), expected points (Burke [2]), Gramacy et al. [1] logistic regression, Cervone et al. [3] Pointwise, Schulte et al. [6,7] Markov game models for NHL, Pettigrew [5] win probabilities, Liu & Schulte [4] Deep RL. Multi-week traps: overfitting to single season, ignoring roster changes across weeks, context drift (score differential semantics change over season), entropy threshold stability across different opponents, EI parameter (σ) calibration across weeks.

4. <RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND>: Crisis habit regression vs counter-trap vs clock. This is a bit abstract. I need to interpret "crisis habit regression" as teams/players reverting to habitual plays under pressure (late game, tight score). "Counter-trap" as the framework's adjustment for risky plays near end of game (negative I but positive I_adj due to win probability swing). "Clock" as remaining time in minutes driving Poisson win probability. Need to discuss how the model accounts for strategic behavior under time pressure.

5. <CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION>: Physical/biomechanical/weather veto proof. The paper is about hockey event data. Veto layers: physical (ice surface, rink dimensions - coordinate system -100 to 100 ft, y -42.5 to 42.5 ft), biomechanical (player movement limits encoded in event types like passes, checks, shots), weather (indoor hockey, minimal weather effect, but rink temperature/ice quality not in dataset). Adjudication: the framework vetoes breaks in play (whistles, intermissions), limits EI spillover across sequences, boosts near sequence boundaries. Need to state what the model cannot see (biomechanical fatigue, weather) and thus vetoes or assumptions.

6. <RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES>: 3 verifiable RLVR veto scenarios + predictions. RLVR = Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards? Or just counterfactual veto scenarios. I need 3 scenarios where the system would veto or fail, with predictions:
   - Scenario 1: Overtime/sudden death where Poisson win probability model based on regulation time breaks down (remaining time = 0 or sudden death). Veto: CEI threshold extraction invalid because win probability model assumes fixed remaining time. Prediction: highlights miss game-winning OT goals or overweight them.
   - Scenario 2: Power-play / manpower differential context not captured if goalie pulled? Actually manpower is in context. But if event dataset missing optical tracking for off-puck movement, the Markov state may miss screening/traffic. Veto: low-impact but high-interest events (spectacular save) not captured because value model only uses event data, not optical tracking of all players.
   - Scenario 3: Entropy threshold forces inclusion of low-impact events when high-impact events are all same type (e.g., all goals in soccer). Veto: minimum entropy H=1.0 forces dilution. Prediction: highlight reel includes mediocre passes to satisfy entropy, reducing fan interest.

I need to ensure total word count >= 1000 words across sections. THINK_TRACE alone >=400 words. Let me plan word counts:
- THINK_TRACE: ~500 words
- SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS: ~250 words
- RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY: ~200 words
- RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND: ~200 words
- CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION: ~200 words
- RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES: ~200 words
Total ~1550 words. Good.

Important constraints:
- No betting lines. I must avoid spreads, totals, moneylines, odds. I can mention "win probability" since that's in the paper, but not betting odds.
- No toy equations. Use real formal LaTeX from paper. Don't make up Force/Fatigue ratios.
- Cite exact [PAGE N] markers and verbatim quotes when source pages provided.

Let me draft carefully.

THINK_TRACE content:
Start with the paper's objective: automated highlight/lowlight extraction for team invasion sports using explainable spatio-temporal game models. Multi-hop derivation:
1. Raw event data (8,810,580 NHL events, [PAGE 8]) -> each event has timestamp, type, coords, outcome.
2. State valuation via Markov model: finite states defined by event type, location, outcome, team; contexts by period, score differential, manpower, goalies [PAGE 8-9]. Value iteration assigns V(s) = P(score before end of play sequence) [PAGE 9].
3. Event impact I(a) = difference in value changes between base and opposing teams [PAGE 3]. Positive I means increased likelihood of scoring relative to opponent.
4. Game context adjustment: win probability model uses league-wide even-strength zero-score differential scoring rate + remaining time (minutes) to generate Poisson score-count distributions [PAGE 4]. Combined with current score differential to get win probabilities. I_adj(e) weights impact by Δwin probability if base scores vs if opponent scores [PAGE 4].
5. Variety constraint: minimum entropy H = -Σ p_i log p_i over event types [PAGE 5]. If top-impact list entropy < threshold, swap in next-highest impact event of different type to maximize entropy [PAGE 5].
6. Temporal smoothing: EI(I_adj^(e), t) continuous function, e.g., Gaussian whose height ∝ |I_adj| [PAGE 6]. CEI(t) = Σ EI over all events [PAGE 6].
7. Extraction: threshold CEI; clip length = duration above threshold [PAGE 5-6]. Breaks in play reset EI to sequence boundaries; average-EI spillover boosts near sequence start/end [PAGE 6-7].
8. Mini-game: wide EI tail, high highlight seconds, treat every whistle as break, ignore sequences <10 events [PAGE 10-11].

Gray-zone audit:
- Assumption EI ≈ fan interest is explicitly unverified ("correspondence between EI and fan interest remains an assumption" [PAGE 13]).
- Proprietary SPORTLOGiQ computer vision dataset; reproducibility limited [PAGE 8].
- Markov model terminal states (goal, neutral zone faceoff) ignore shot quality beyond event outcome [PAGE 9].
- Poisson win model assumes league-wide constant scoring rate; ignores team-specific offense/defense [PAGE 4].
- Gaussian σ is sport/use-case dependent; no empirical selection criterion given [PAGE 6].
- Entropy threshold H=1.0 arbitrary; Appendix A shows example but no validation [PAGE 5].
- "Breaks in play" definition varies by sport; hockey periods vs soccer halves vs football downs [PAGE 6].

I'll write this in formal tone.

SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS:
List equations with LaTeX.
- State value: V(s) = P(team scores before end of play sequence | s), s ∈ S where S defined by (event type, location, outcome, team, context). Context c = (period, score differential, manpower differential, goalie status) [PAGE 8-9].
- Reward: R(s) = 1.0 if goal for team, 0.0 otherwise. Terminal states: goal, neutral zone faceoff [PAGE 9].
- Impact: I(a) = ΔV_base(e) − ΔV_opposing(e) [PAGE 3].
- Win probability: Poisson(λ = rate × remaining time [minutes]) for score counts [PAGE 4].
- Adjusted impact: I_adj(e) ∝ [P(win_base | base scores) − P(win_base | current)] + [P(win_opp | opp scores) − P(win_opp | current)]? Actually text says first term home team increase, second visitor team increase. I'll write: I_adj(e) = w_home ΔP_home + w_visitor ΔP_visitor, where ΔP are win-probability changes from immediate goal [PAGE 4].
- Entropy: H = −Σ_{i=1}^n p_i log p_i, p_i = count(type_i)/total events [PAGE 5].
- CEI: CEI(t) = Σ_{j=1}^{n_events} EI(I_adj^(e_j), t) [PAGE 6].
- Gaussian EI: EI ∝ |I_adj| × exp(−(t − t_e)^2 / (2σ^2)) [PAGE 6].
- Sequence-limited EI: EI_s(e, t) = 0 if t outside sequence s [PAGE 6].
- Boundary boost: average per-second EI extended infinitely past sequence start/end [PAGE 7].

Units: probabilities dimensionless [0,1], time seconds/minutes, distance feet (x ∈ [−100,100], y ∈ [−42.5, 42.5]) [PAGE 8]. Impact units: probability points (change in win probability). Entropy units: bits (if log base 2) or nats (natural log); paper doesn't specify base [PAGE 5].

Breakdown: singularity when σ → 0 (CEI → discrete I), σ → ∞ (CEI flat, suited to extended highlights) [PAGE 6]. Breakdown when remaining time → 0 (Poisson λ → 0, win probability degenerates to current score) [PAGE 4]. Breakdown when play sequence has <10 events (ignored in mini-game) [PAGE 11].

RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY:
Historical lineage:
- Expected point values (Brian Burke, NFL) [PAGE 3, ref 2].
- Gramacy, Taddy, Tian regularized logistic regression for player contribution [PAGE 3, ref 1].
- Cervone et al. Pointwise (NBA optical tracking, possession value) [PAGE 3, ref 3].
- Liu & Schulte deep RL for hockey context-aware evaluation [PAGE 3, ref 4].
- Pettigrew win-probability adjustment for NHL offensive productivity [PAGE 3-4, ref 5].
- Schulte et al. Markov game models for NHL actions/locations/team performance [PAGE 3, 8, refs 6-7].

Multi-week traps:
- Roster churn and tactical drift across weeks make a static Markov transition matrix stale [PAGE 8-9 dataset is two seasons].
- Score differential semantics change late season (playoff push vs regular season); win-probability model uses league-wide rate, not team-specific [PAGE 4].
- Entropy threshold calibrated on one game may fail across a week of varied opponents [PAGE 5].
- Gaussian σ parameter tuned for hockey may not transfer to soccer/football without re-calibration each week [PAGE 6].
- Copyright/proprietary data (SPORTLOGiQ) prevents external validation across weeks [PAGE 8].

RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND:
- Crisis habit regression: Under late-game, tight-score pressure, teams regress to habitual, high-variance plays (e.g., risky passes when trailing by one with 30 seconds left) [PAGE 4]. The paper notes such plays may have negative raw impact I (increase opponent scoring likelihood more than own) but positive I_adj because a goal swing has outsized win-probability effect [PAGE 4].
- Counter-trap: The context adjustment is itself a counter-trap: it rewards risk-taking precisely when conventional value models would punish it, aligning with fan interest in desperation plays [PAGE 4].
- Clock: Remaining time in minutes enters the Poisson win-probability model; as clock winds down, λ shrinks, making goal swings more valuable [PAGE 4]. The framework's CEI temporal smoothing (Gaussian tails) interacts with clock: near period breaks, EI spillover is cut, then boundary-boosted [PAGE 6-7].
- Recursion: Fans model players' crisis habits; players anticipate fan/coach reactions; the model captures first-order value impact but not higher-order theory-of-mind (e.g., a decoy pass whose value is in drawing defenders, not in the pass outcome itself) [PAGE 13 discussion notes near-events and unusual executions are missed].

CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION:
Physical layer: Rink geometry fixed (x: −100 to +100 ft, y: −42.5 to +42.5 ft, origin ice center) [PAGE 8]. The model assumes possession team attacks positive x-axis; coordinate orientation is a physical veto against ambiguous spatial encoding.
Biomechanical layer: Event taxonomy (13 general types, 108 outcomes) encodes observable player actions but not biomechanical load, fatigue, or micro-movements [PAGE 8]. Veto: no optical tracking of all players; state value is event-based, not continuous biomechanical state [PAGE 3 ref 3 contrast].
Weather layer: Indoor ice hockey; weather not a variable in dataset [PAGE 8]. Rink temperature/ice quality not modeled; veto against external environmental modulation.
Cross-layer adjudication:
- Breaks in play (whistles, intermissions) are hard vetoes: EI cannot spill across sequences [PAGE 6].
- Boundary effects vetoed via average-EI infinite extension boost [PAGE 7].
- Mini-game veto: sequences with <10 events ignored [PAGE 11].
- Single-sport bias: framework demonstrated only on NHL; generalization to other invasion sports is asserted but not physically validated [PAGE 13].

RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES:
Need 3 verifiable scenarios + predictions.

Scenario 1: Sudden-death overtime. The win-probability model relies on "remaining time in minutes" and Poisson score-count generation for regulation [PAGE 4]. In OT, the first goal ends the game; the Poisson model's assumption of multiple scoring opportunities breaks down. Veto: CEI threshold extraction should be disabled or re-weighted because Δwin probability from a goal is binary (1.0 or 0.0) rather than a marginal probability shift. Prediction: The system will either underweight OT game-winners (treating them as ordinary events) or fail to generate clips because win-probability gradients vanish after the first goal.

Scenario 2: Empty-net / goalie-pulled endgame. Context includes "whether goalie is on ice" [PAGE 8], but the Markov reward is binary (goal = 1.0) and terminal states are goal/faceoff [PAGE 9]. If a team pulls the goalie, the value of defensive events (blocks) changes non-linearly, but the model uses the same transition counts. Veto: When goalie is off and score differential is ±1 in final 2 minutes, veto lowlight extraction for defensive errors because the Markov state space does not distinguish goalie-pulled transition dynamics sufficiently. Prediction: Negative-impact passes/blocks in empty-net situations will be mis-ranked; lowlights will miss catastrophic turnovers that directly lose the game.

Scenario 3: Entropy-forced dilution. Minimum entropy H threshold (e.g., H ≥ 1.0) forces variety [PAGE 5]. If a game contains ten high-impact goals (all same event type), the top-impact list entropy falls below threshold, and the algorithm swaps in lower-impact passes to satisfy H [PAGE 5]. Veto: When the top-k events by |I_adj| are homogeneous (single event type), the entropy constraint vetoes pure high-impact selection. Prediction: The highlight reel will include mediocre passes of lower fan interest, reducing average CEI per clip and violating the user's implicit desire for only the most dramatic moments.

I need to ensure no betting lines. "Win probability" is okay, it's not a betting line per se, but I should avoid framing it as odds. The paper uses it as a modeling concept.

Also need to ensure verbatim quotes where citing pages. I can quote short phrases.

Let me check page citations carefully against the source text:

User said PAGES: 12. I should cite up to [PAGE 12] mostly. I can mention [PAGE 13] for the assumption quote but the user said 12 pages. However the source text includes page 13-15 markers. I'll stick to citing [PAGE 1] through [PAGE 12] for the main content, and maybe [PAGE 13] if needed but I'll try to stay within 1-12. Actually, the EI/fan interest assumption quote is on page 13 in the source. But user says PAGES: 12. To be safe, I can reference the discussion generally without a specific page or say [PAGE 12] if I can find it there. Looking at page 12: it ends with Figure 6 caption and section 6 discussion start? Actually page 12 in source has Figure 6 and then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 11" then Discussion section starts after that? Wait, let's look at the source structure:

The source has page markers embedded:
"2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 10" then Section 5.3, Figure 5, then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 11" then 5.4 Graphical Game Summary, Figure 6, then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 12" then Discussion section? Let's check:

Looking at the raw text:
"...Figure 6: Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final" then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 11" appears? No, let's trace:

After Figure 5 caption: "**Figure 5:** _CEI_ for mini-game with goal _I_ included" then page marker "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 10" appears before it? Actually the text shows:

"These result in a more fragmented-looking vizualisation as seen in Figure 5. The resulting set of clips can be viewed at the corresponding link in Appendix B. 

2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

10 


**Figure 5:** _CEI_ for mini-game with goal _I_ included 

### **5.4 Graphical Game Summary**..."

Then later: "**Figure 6:** Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final 

## **6. Discussion**..."

Then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

11 


Further work can be done..."

Then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

12 


## **References**"

Wait, the page markers seem offset. Let me re-read carefully:

"...Figure 5... 
2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

10 


**Figure 5:** ..."

So page 10 contains Section 5.3 and Figure 5.

Then 5.4 starts after Figure 5. Then "**Figure 6:** ..." then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 11". So page 11 contains Figure 6 and start of Discussion? Actually the Discussion header appears after Figure 6. Let's see:

"**Figure 6:** Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final 

## **6. Discussion** 

We have introduced a framework...

Then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

11 


Further work can be done on the specific needs within each sport..."

Wait, the page break "11" appears in the middle of Discussion? Actually:

"The nature of sports... [PAGE 11?] ... This approach is generalized to the greatest extent possible. In producing results from Ice Hockey data, modifications were inevitably made to best accommodate the nature of the game. 

2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

11

Hmm, it's ambiguous. But I can safely cite [PAGE 12] for References? No, References start after page 12 marker maybe.

To avoid errors, I'll cite pages where I'm confident based on the visible page number footers:

- Abstract/Intro: [PAGE 1]
- Section 2: [PAGE 2]
- Section 3.1: [PAGE 3]
- Section 3.2: [PAGE 4]
- Section 3.3/3.3.1 entropy: [PAGE 5]
- Section 3.3.2/3.3.3 CEI: [PAGE 6]
- Section 3.3.4 breaks: [PAGE 7]
- Section 4 Dataset: [PAGE 8]
- Section 4.1 Markov: [PAGE 9]
- Section 5.1 Single events: [PAGE 10]
- Section 5.2 positive/negative: [PAGE 11]
- Section 5.3 mini-game/5.4: [PAGE 12]
- Discussion/acknowledgements: [PAGE 13] (but I'll avoid or use carefully)

Actually user said PAGES: 12. I will cite [PAGE 1] through [PAGE 12]. For the EI/fan interest assumption, it's in Discussion which might be [PAGE 12] or [PAGE 13]. Looking at text: after Figure 6, Discussion starts, then page marker 11? This is confusing. I'll just cite [PAGE 12] for the discussion/generalization limitations, since Figure 6 and Discussion are around there. Or I can say "[PAGE 12–13]" but better to be precise. I'll cite [PAGE 12] for Discussion start and note the assumption is stated there.

Actually, let's look at the raw text near the end:

"## **6. Discussion** 

We have introduced a framework for automatic highlight and lowlight generation that can be applied to many sports. This framework can accommodate a host of requirements, from the case of single-second social media clip reels to shortened mini-games. We have shown that the same approach can produce interesting visual narratives of a game. 

The nature of sports as entertainment is such that interesting events often occur whose interest will not be reflected in the events' value: near-events that don't quite materialize; events executed in particularly unusual ways; even celebrations can be of much interest that will never be captured with this approach. On the other hand, as in-game valuation models continue to improve in major sports, the highlight framework's output will become more and more compelling. 

This approach is generalized to the greatest extent possible. In producing results from Ice Hockey data, modifications were inevitably made to best accommodate the nature of the game.

Further work can be done on the specific needs within each sport and how best to integrate this framework given those needs. 


**Figure 6:** Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final"

Wait, Figure 6 appears after page marker 11? That seems out of order because Figure 6 caption was mentioned earlier. Let me re-read the source more carefully.

Actually in the source text provided:

After Section 5.4 text: "An example is shown in Figure 6." then page marker "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 11" then "## **6. Discussion** ..." then text ... then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 12" then "## **References**". Wait no, let me look:

The source text:

"While visual game summaries do already exist, they tend to rely on an aggregate of no more than a handful of basic measures, such as shots or goals. _CEI_ allows us to plot a representation that accounts for all events in a game, while also removing the noise that would result from simply plotting discrete event values for each team. An example is shown in Figure 6. 

## **6. Discussion** 

We have introduced a framework..."

So Figure 6 reference is before Discussion. Then Discussion text. Then "Further work can be done..." then page marker? Actually I see:

"This approach is generalized to the greatest extent possible. In producing results from Ice Hockey data, modifications were inevitably made to best accommodate the nature of the game.

Further work can be done on the specific needs within each sport and how best to integrate this framework given those needs. 


**Figure 6:** Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final"

This is weird because Figure 6 caption appears after page 11 marker but the text references it before Discussion. It seems the PDF page extraction may have figure captions displaced. Anyway.

Then: "Ultimately, the correspondence between _EI_ and fan interest remains an assumption. It would be worthwhile to explore viewer responses..." then "2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 12" then References? Actually I see:

"Ultimately, the correspondence between _EI_ and fan interest remains an assumption. It would be worthwhile to explore viewer responses to various parameterizations of the techniques described here using A/B testing or a similar approach. 

The use-cases of isolating high and low-impact events need not be limited to media. The same clips could also be used to highlight a player's strengths and weaknesses to coaching staff in game reviews and in scouting. 


## **Acknowledgements**

Then page marker 12 then References.

Wait, in the source:

"Ultimately, the correspondence between _EI_ and fan interest remains an assumption... 

The use-cases... 


## **Acknowledgements** 

The authors wish to reiterate...

## **References**"

Hmm, actually looking at the very end:

"Ultimately, the correspondence between _EI_ and fan interest remains an assumption. It would be worthwhile to explore viewer responses to various parameterizations of the techniques described here using A/B testing or a similar approach. 

The use-cases of isolating high and low-impact events need not be limited to media. The same clips could also be used to highlight a player's strengths and weaknesses to coaching staff in game reviews and in scouting. 


## **Acknowledgements** 

The authors wish to reiterate the usefulness of Oliver Schulte’s past work on Markov game models to this research. Thanks to Jesus Servin who gave the highlight reels their edge. Nick Czuzoj-Shulman and Matt Perri were a great help in studying the early output of these techniques. David Yu and Sam Gregory kept gave useful feedback along the way.

## **References** 

[1] Robert B. Gramacy..."

Wait, that doesn't make sense because page 12 marker appears before References but after Acknowledgements. Then References are on page 12? Then Appendix A on page 14? Actually:

"2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by:

Okay, so page numbers: References start on page 12 (or 13?), Appendix on 13/14, etc. But user said PAGES: 12. This likely means the PDF has 12 pages of content, but the extracted text includes references/appendix making it 15 markers. I'll cite within [PAGE 1] to [PAGE 12] as much as possible. For the fan interest assumption quote, it's in Discussion which seems to be before page marker 11 or around there. Actually looking at source:

After Section 5.4 text mentioning Figure 6, then "## **6. Discussion**" starts. Then there is text, then page marker 11 appears? Let's see exact sequence from source:

"An example is shown in Figure 6. 

## **6. Discussion** 

We have introduced a framework..."

Then later:

"In producing results from Ice Hockey data, modifications were inevitably made to best accommodate the nature of the game. 


2019 Research Papers Competition Presented by: 

11 


Further work can be done..."

Then:

"**Figure 6:** Graphical summary of VGK vs WSH, Game 5 of 17/18 NHL Stanley Cup final"

Wait, Figure 6 caption appears after page 11? That can't be right if Figure 6 was referenced before Discussion. It might be that the figure image and caption are on a different page in the PDF layout. But for citation purposes, I'll cite the textual location.

Given the ambiguity, I will cite [PAGE 12] for Discussion/limitations since the References start at page 12 marker and Discussion precedes it. Actually, I'll just cite [PAGE 12] for the assumption quote and discussion, acknowledging it's in the final content pages.

Alternatively, I can avoid citing page 13 and just say [PAGE 12] for discussion and limitations. That's fine.

Now let's write the response. I must ensure it's all in the XML sections and no text outside? The user says "across these exact XML sections". I should output only the XML sections, presumably wrapped in a root or just the sections. I'll output the six sections in order. No markdown code blocks around them? I can just output raw XML. I'll make sure each section is properly tagged.

Word count check: I need >=1000 words total. Let me draft generously.

Let's begin drafting each section.

<THINK_TRACE>
(>=400 words). Deep multi-hop derivation & gray-zone audit.

I'll write about 500-600 words.

<SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS>
Formal LaTeX, units, page citations, breakdown. About 250-300 words.

<RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY>
Historical/scientific lineage & multi-week traps. About 200 words.

<RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND>
Crisis habit regression vs counter-trap vs clock. About 200 words.

<CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION>
Physical/biomechanical/weather veto proof. About 200 words.

<RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES>
3 verifiable RLVR veto scenarios + predictions. About 250 words.

Total should exceed 1000.

Let's write.

Important: LaTeX formatting. Use \( ... \) or \[ ... \] or just LaTeX commands. Since it's XML, I need to be careful with special characters like <, >, &. I'll avoid raw < and > in text, or escape them. In LaTeX, I might use \in, \Sigma, etc. I'll write LaTeX in plain text within XML tags. XML requires escaping & as &amp; but since this is likely rendered as text, I'll avoid ampersands. I'll use "and" instead of &. Use \text{for} etc.

Actually, for safety in XML, I should avoid characters that break XML: <, >, &. I'll write LaTeX without those characters or escape them. Since LaTeX uses \leq etc, I won't use raw < or >. I'll use \lt and \gt if needed, or just words.

Let's draft.

THINK_TRACE:

The framework proceeds through eight dependent transformations. First, raw play-by-play event data from the SPORTLOGiQ computer-vision pipeline supplies 8,810,580 NHL events from the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons, each tagged with timestamp, event type, x–y coordinates, and outcome [PAGE 8]. Second, these events populate a finite Markov state space; each state is defined by event type, location, outcome, and team, while context is defined by period, score differential, manpower differential, and goalie status [PAGE 8–9]. Value iteration assigns each state a value equal to the probability that the associated team scores before the end of the current play sequence, where play sequences begin at a faceoff and terminate at a faceoff or goal [PAGE 9]. Third, the base-team impact score for an action is defined as the difference between the value change produced by the base team’s event and the value change produced by the opposing team’s event; positive impact means the base team’s next-scoring likelihood has risen relative to the opponent [PAGE 3]. Fourth, raw impact is context-adjusted using an in-game win-probability model: league-wide even-strength zero-score-differential scoring rate combined with remaining time in minutes generates a Poisson distribution of score counts for each team, which, together with the current score differential, yields team win probabilities [PAGE 4]. For each event, the model computes current win probability, plus counterfactual win probabilities if the base team scores immediately and if the opposing team scores immediately; the deltas weight the impact so that tight, late-game events receive higher adjusted impact [PAGE 4]. Fifth, to prevent monotony, a minimum entropy constraint H = −Σ p_i log p_i over distinct event types is imposed; if the highest-impact clip list falls below a user-set threshold (e.g., H = 1.0), lower-impact events of underrepresented types are swapped in to maximize entropy [PAGE 5]. Sixth, discrete impacts are smoothed into a continuous Event Interest function EI(I_adj^(e), t), exemplified by a Gaussian whose height scales with absolute impact and whose standard deviation controls the tradeoff between isolated events and event sequences [PAGE 6]. Seventh, Cumulative Event Interest CEI(t) sums overlapping EI curves across all events at each moment; highlight clips are extracted by thresholding CEI, so clip length equals the duration for which interest remains above threshold rather than being fixed [PAGE 5–6]. Eighth, breaks in play (whistles, intermissions) terminate EI spillover between sequences; boundary effects are corrected by injecting average per-second EI as if each sequence extended infinitely into the past and future [PAGE 6–7].

Gray-zone audit: The paper explicitly states that the correspondence between EI and fan interest remains an assumption and proposes A/B testing as future work [PAGE 12]. The dataset is proprietary, limiting external reproducibility [PAGE 8]. The Markov model’s terminal states (goal, neutral-zone faceoff) and binary reward structure ignore shot quality and continuous player positioning [PAGE 9]. The Poisson win model uses a league-wide scoring rate rather than team-specific offense/defense parameters [PAGE 4]. The Gaussian bandwidth σ lacks an empirical selection rule; as σ → 0, CEI collapses to discrete impact values, and as σ → ∞, CEI flattens into extended highlights [PAGE 6]. The entropy threshold H = 1.0 is illustrated in Appendix A but not validated across games [PAGE 5]. Finally, “breaks in play” are defined heterogeneously across sports (periods in hockey, halves in soccer, downs in football), so the sequence-boundary logic does not transfer without sport-specific recalibration [PAGE 6].

That's good. Around 450 words.

SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS:

Formal notation:

State space: s ∈ S where S = {(event type, location, outcome, team, context)}; context c = (period, score differential, manpower differential, goalie status) [PAGE 8–9].
State value: V(s) = P(team scores before end of play sequence | s), dimensionless probability in [0,1] [PAGE 9].
Reward: R(s) = 1.0 if goal for the evaluating team, 0.0 otherwise; terminal states = {goal, neutral-zone faceoff} [PAGE 9].
Impact score: I(a) = ΔV_base(e) − ΔV_opposing(e), measured in probability points [PAGE 3].
Win-probability context: score counts K_home, K_visitor ~ Poisson(λ = league_rate × remaining time [minutes]); win probabilities P_win derived from current score differential and K distributions [PAGE 4].
Adjusted impact: I_adj(e) = w_home ΔP_home(win | base scores) + w_visitor ΔP_visitor(win | opposing scores), where ΔP are counterfactual win-probability shifts from an immediate goal [PAGE 4].
Entropy: H = −Σ_{i=1}^{n} p_i log p_i; p_i = count(event type i) / total events in clip list; n = number of distinct event types [PAGE 5].
Event Interest: EI(I_adj^(e), t) ∝ |I_adj| × kernel(t − t_e); example Gaussian kernel exp(−(t − t_e)^2 / (2σ^2)), σ in seconds [PAGE 6].
Cumulative Event Interest: CEI(t) = Σ_{j=1}^{N_events} EI(I_adj^(e_j), t), dimensionless interest intensity [PAGE 6].
Sequence-limited EI: EI_s(e, t) = 0 when t lies outside play sequence s containing e [PAGE 6].
Boundary boost: average per-second EI extended beyond sequence start and end to prevent CEI collapse at cutoffs [PAGE 7].

Units: spatial coordinates in feet with x ∈ [−100, +100], y ∈ [−42.5, +42.5], origin at ice center, possession team attacking positive x [PAGE 8]; time in seconds or minutes; counts dimensionless; entropy in nats (natural log) unless base specified [PAGE 5].

Breakdown regimes: σ → 0 recovers discrete I values (no temporal integration); σ → ∞ yields flat CEI suited only to extended mini-games; remaining time → 0 degenerates the Poisson win model to the current score differential; play sequences with fewer than 10 events are excluded from mini-game extraction [PAGE 6, 11].

That's around 250 words.

RETROCAUSAL_GENEALOGY:

Lineage: The framework descends from expected-point valuation (Burke, NFL) [PAGE 3, ref. 2], regularized logistic regression for player contribution (Gramacy, Taddy, Tian) [PAGE 3, ref. 1], real-time possession value via optical tracking (Cervone et al., Pointwise, NBA) [PAGE 3, ref. 3], deep reinforcement learning for context-aware hockey evaluation (Liu & Schulte) [PAGE 3, ref. 4], win-probability-adjusted offensive productivity (Pettigrew) [PAGE 3–4, ref. 5], and Markov game models for NHL actions and locations (Schulte et al.) [PAGE 3, 8, refs. 6–7]. The authors explicitly acknowledge Oliver Schulte’s past work on Markov game models [PAGE 13? Actually Acknowledgements page]. I'll cite [PAGE 12] for acknowledgements? Wait, acknowledgements are before page 12 marker maybe. I'll cite [PAGE 12] as it's near the end.

Multi-week traps: A static Markov transition matrix estimated over two NHL seasons does not capture roster churn, tactical drift, or personnel changes across a competitive week [PAGE 8–9]. The league-wide Poisson scoring rate ignores team-specific offensive and defensive identities that diverge over a multi-week schedule [PAGE 4]. An entropy threshold H = 1.0 calibrated on one game may force inappropriate variety across a slate of opponents with differing event distributions [PAGE 5]. The Gaussian bandwidth σ tuned for hockey flow will misrepresent soccer or football if carried forward week-to-week without re-estimation [PAGE 6]. Because SPORTLOGiQ data are proprietary, external auditors cannot re-validate the state-value function as new weeks of data arrive [PAGE 8].

Around 180 words. Fine.

RECURSIVE_THEORY_OF_MIND:

Crisis habit regression: Under end-game pressure—specifically when trailing by one goal with roughly thirty seconds remaining—teams regress to high-variance, desperate actions (e.g., risky passes that increase the opponent’s next-scoring likelihood more than their own) [PAGE 4]. Raw impact I(a) would mark such plays negative [PAGE 3–4].

Counter-trap: The context-adjusted score I_adj(e) functions as a counter-trap to this regression: it rewards the risky play because a goal for the trailing team produces a disproportionate win-probability swing relative to a goal for the leading team [PAGE 4]. The model thus aligns with fan interest in desperation plays even when conventional event valuation punishes them.

Clock: Remaining time in minutes enters the Poisson win-probability generator; as the clock approaches zero, λ shrinks and the marginal value of a goal spike [PAGE 4]. CEI temporal smoothing interacts with this clock: Gaussian tails determine whether pre-goal buildup is included (long left tail for soccer goals) or post-event celebration is emphasized (long right tail for baseball hits) [PAGE 6]. Near period breaks, EI spillover is hard-stopped and then boundary-boosted, so the clock’s discontinuities are explicitly modeled rather than smoothed away [PAGE 6–7].

Recursive limitation: The framework captures first-order value impact but not higher-order theory of mind—decoy runs, screens, or celebrations whose interest is independent of scoring value are excluded by design [PAGE 12].

Around 190 words.

CROSS_LAYER_VETO_ADJUDICATION:

Physical layer: Rink geometry is fixed and encoded as x ∈ [−100, +100] ft, y ∈ [−42.5, +42.5] ft with origin at ice center; all coordinates are re-oriented so the possession team attacks the positive x-axis [PAGE 8]. This coordinate convention is a physical veto: any event record violating this orientation or spatial bounds is excluded or corrected before state valuation.

Biomechanical layer: The event taxonomy comprises 13 general action types and 108 specific outcomes (passes, blocks, shots, checks, loose-puck recoveries, etc.) but does not encode biomechanical load, player fatigue, or continuous optical tracking of all skaters [PAGE 8]. The Markov state value is event-based and therefore cannot represent screening, traffic, or off-puck positioning that modulate biomechanical risk [PAGE 3, ref. 3].

Weather layer: The dataset is indoor NHL hockey; ice temperature, rink humidity, and external weather are not variables [PAGE 8]. The model implicitly assumes constant ice conditions and thus vetoes environmental modulation of event value.

Cross-layer adjudication:
1. Breaks in play (whistles, intermissions) are hard vetoes: EI cannot spill across sequence boundaries [PAGE 6].
2. Boundary collapse at sequence start/end is adjudicated by injecting average per-second EI as if each sequence extended infinitely [PAGE 7].
3. Mini-game extraction vetoes any play sequence with fewer than 10 events [PAGE 11].
4. Single-sport validation: the framework is physically demonstrated only on NHL hockey; generalization to other invasion sports is asserted but not biomechanically or spatially validated [PAGE 12].

Around 200 words.

RLVR_COUNTERFACTUAL_VETOES:

Scenario 1 (Sudden-death overtime veto): The win-probability model assumes regulation-style multiple scoring opportunities via a Poisson process over remaining minutes [PAGE 4]. In sudden-death overtime, the first goal ends the game, so the Poisson λ and marginal win-probability deltas degenerate. Verifiable veto: disable CEI thresholding or force binary goal-weighting in overtime. Prediction: The system will either underweight game-winning overtime goals (treating them as ordinary events) or fail to emit clips because post-goal win-probability gradients vanish after the first score.

Scenario 2 (Empty-net endgame veto): Context includes goalie status, but the Markov reward is binary (goal = 1.0) and terminal states are goal or neutral-zone faceoff [PAGE 9]. With the goalie pulled and under two minutes remaining, defensive-event value changes non-linearly; the transition matrix does not separately model empty-net dynamics. Verifiable veto: suppress lowlight extraction for defensive errors (missed receptions, dangerous turnovers) when goalie = off and |score differential| = 1 in the final 120 seconds. Prediction: Catastrophic empty-net turnovers that directly lose the game will be mis-ranked as ordinary negative-impact events; lowlights will omit the most consequential defensive failures.

Scenario 3 (Entropy-forced dilution veto): The entropy constraint H ≥ 1.0 requires variety across event types [PAGE 5]. If a game’s top-k events by |I_adj| are homogeneous (e.g., ten goals), the algorithm swaps in lower-impact passes or blocks to raise entropy. Verifiable veto: when the top-k list is dominated by a single event type, replace the lowest-impact high-value clip with the highest-impact clip of a rare type, regardless of CEI magnitude. Prediction: The final reel will contain mediocre passes of lower fan interest, reducing mean CEI per clip and violating the user’s implicit preference for purely dramatic moments.

Around 220 words.

Now check for betting lines: I used "win probability" but not "odds", "spread", "moneyline", "total". That's fine. I should ensure I don't use "odds" anywhere. Let me scan. No betting terms.

Zero toy equations: I used formal equations from the paper. No invented Force/Fatigue ratios.

Page citations: I used [PAGE N] throughout.

Word count: likely >1000.

One concern: XML validity. I have LaTeX with characters like Σ, ∞, →, ∈, ≤, ≥. These are Unicode and should be fine in XML as long as encoding is UTF-8. No raw & or <. I used "and" instead of &. I used "Δ" which is fine. I used "λ" fine. I used "σ" fine. I used "−" minus sign. Should be okay. I need to avoid using "<" or ">" in LaTeX. I used \in [−100, +100] which uses brackets, fine. I didn't use < or > symbols.

Wait, I used "H ≥ 1.0" which contains ≥. That's fine Unicode. I used "|score differential| = 1" with vertical bars, fine.

I should double check that I didn't accidentally write a "<" in LaTeX like \lt. I didn't. Good.

Also I need to make sure the output contains ONLY the XML sections or at least starts with them. The user didn't specify a root element. I'll just output the six sections sequentially. That should satisfy.

Let's refine the text to ensure quality and accurate page citations.

One thing: In THINK_TRACE I cited [PAGE 12] for the fan interest assumption quote. Looking at source, that quote is in Discussion. The page marker before Discussion might be 11, and the quote might be on page 11 or 12. Given the messy pagination, I'll cite [PAGE 12] since it's in the latter part of the document before References. Actually, to be safer, I could say [PAGE 11–12] but the user wants exact [PAGE N] markers. I'll use [PAGE 12] as it's the last content page before References. Alternatively, I can avoid that specific citation and say "[PAGE 12]" for Discussion limitations generally. That's fine.

Actually, looking again at source:

"Ultimately, the correspondence between _EI_ and fan interest remains an assumption..." appears right before Acknowledgements, which is right before page marker 12 and References. So that quote is on page 11 or 12. I'll cite [PAGE 12] as the discussion section. It's close enough and defensible.

Another check: In SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS I said "entropy in nats (natural log) unless base specified [PAGE 5]". The paper doesn't specify log base. I should be careful not to invent. I wrote "unless base specified" which is an assumption but clearly marked. That's okay.

In the same section, I said "σ in seconds". The paper says standard deviation of Gaussian function but doesn't explicitly state units. However time is in seconds/minutes, so σ would be in time units. I'll say "σ in time units (seconds or minutes)" to be safe.

Let's also ensure I mention that some equations are image-based in the original and I am reconstructing from textual description. That's honest and avoids "inventing" equations. I can add a line: "Where the original PDF renders equations as images, the following notation is reconstructed strictly from the paper’s verbal definitions and variable names [PAGE 3–7]." This is good practice.

I'll add that to SOURCE_OPERATORS_AND_EQUATIONS.

Now let's assemble final output.

Word count estimate:
THINK_TRACE: ~470 words
SOURCE_OPERATORS: ~300 words
RETROCAUSAL: ~190 words
RECURSIVE: ~190 words
CROSS_LAYER: ~210 words
RLVR: ~230 words
Total: ~1590 words. Good.

I will now produce the final answer.

Counter-trap: The context-adjusted score I_adj(e) functions as a counter-trap to this regression: it rewards the risky play because a goal for the trailing team produces a disproportionate win-probability swing relative to a goal for the leading team [PAGE 4]. The model thus aligns with fan interest in desperation plays even when conventional event valuation punishes them.

Clock: Remaining time in minutes enters the Poisson win-probability generator; as the clock approaches zero, λ shrinks and the marginal value of a goal spike [PAGE 4]. CEI temporal smoothing interacts with this clock: Gaussian tails determine whether pre-goal buildup is included (long left tail for soccer goals) or post-event celebration is emphasized (long right tail for baseball hits) [PAGE 6]. Near period breaks, EI spillover is hard-stopped and then boundary-boosted, so the clock’s discontinuities are explicitly modeled rather than smoothed away [PAGE 6–7].

Recursive limitation: The framework captures first-order value impact but not higher-order theory of mind—decoy runs, screens, or celebrations whose interest is independent of scoring value are excluded by design [PAGE 12].

Physical layer: Rink geometry is fixed and encoded as x ∈ [−100, +100] ft, y ∈ [−42.5, +42.5] ft with origin at ice center; all coordinates are re-oriented so the possession team attacks the positive x-axis [PAGE 8]. This coordinate convention is a physical veto: any event record violating this orientation or spatial bounds is excluded or corrected before state valuation.

Biomechanical layer: The event taxonomy comprises 13 general action types and 108 specific outcomes (passes, blocks, shots, checks, loose-puck recoveries, etc.) but does not encode biomechanical load, player fatigue, or continuous optical tracking of all skaters [PAGE 8]. The Markov state value is event-based and therefore cannot represent screening, traffic, or off-puck positioning that modulate biomechanical risk [PAGE 3, ref. 3].

Weather layer: The dataset is indoor NHL hockey; ice temperature, rink humidity, and external weather are not variables [PAGE 8]. The model implicitly assumes constant ice conditions and thus vetoes environmental modulation of event value.

Cross-layer adjudication:
1. Breaks in play (whistles, intermissions) are hard vetoes: EI cannot spill across sequence boundaries [PAGE 6].
2. Boundary collapse at sequence start/end is adjudicated by injecting average per-second EI as if each sequence extended infinitely [PAGE 7].
3. Mini-game extraction vetoes any play sequence with fewer than 10 events [PAGE 11].
4. Single-sport validation: the framework is physically demonstrated only on NHL hockey; generalization to other invasion sports is asserted but not biomechanically or spatially validated [PAGE 12].

Scenario 1 (Sudden-death overtime veto): The win-probability model assumes regulation-style multiple scoring opportunities via a Poisson process over remaining minutes [PAGE 4]. In sudden-death overtime, the first goal ends the game, so the Poisson λ and marginal win-probability deltas degenerate. Verifiable veto: disable CEI thresholding or force binary goal-weighting in overtime. Prediction: The system will either underweight game-winning overtime goals (treating them as ordinary events) or fail to emit clips because post-goal win-probability gradients vanish after the first score.

Scenario 2 (Empty-net endgame veto): Context includes goalie status, but the Markov reward is binary (goal = 1.0) and terminal states are goal or neutral-zone faceoff [PAGE
